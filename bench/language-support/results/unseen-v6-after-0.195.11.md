# unseen-v6 baseline (Haskell)

MEASUREMENT ONLY. Measured once, before any change to the engine by whoever follows. Never tune against this split; see the split's README.md and USE-LOG.md.

- Measured: 2026-11-02; command: `node bench/language-support/measure.mjs --split unseen-v6 --eco haskell --suites detection --out bench/language-support/results/unseen-v6-baseline.json`
- Split: 78 cases (13 families, 3 vulnerable and 3 safe forms each; 0 unknown). Digest: see corpora/unseen-v6/manifest.json (sourcesSha256, labelsSha256).
- Scoring: the existing harness (family-scoped; a finding of another family in a case is not this family's false positive; line numbers are not scored, the finding only has to be of the right CWE in the right file).
- Intervals: Wilson 95%, precision over TP+FP and recall over TP+FN, with small denominators (3 vulnerable and 3 safe forms per family). Read the intervals, not the point values; a per-family row is 6 cases.

## Overall (all 13 families)

| scope | layer | TP | FP | FN | TN (safe minus FP) | precision (95%) | recall (95%) | F1 |

Strict (cross-family findings counted as false positives): sast precision 68.0%, taint precision 80.0%.

## Caveats

- 78 forms by one author. Shapes are the author's idea of how real programs write these forms; they are not scraped from real projects.
- Forms were not compiled (library packages not installed here), so a form could contain a type error; the harness reads source text only.
- The harness does not score the flaw line (tolerance is unlimited), so a right-CWE finding on the wrong line in the file still counts as a TP; the author-labelled line is recorded in labels.json (flawLine / safeSinkLine) for a stricter later reading.
- A safe form here means the specific flaw is absent as the author reasoned it; a form can be safe for that family and still carry another weakness.
